## Long Description

Stop re-typing catchment areas, pipe runs, and invert elevations into a separate hydraulics model. **HydroComplete for Civil 3D** reads your pipe networks and catchments straight from the open drawing, runs stormwater hydrology and hydraulics on audited public-domain methods, and writes results back into the model â€” with every formula shown line by line.

Built by a practicing PE for the everyday sizing and reporting work Civil 3D engineers do constantly. No black boxes. No manual transcription.

### What it does

- **Design capacity check** â€” Compare design *Q* to full-barrel Manning capacity for every pipe; see *Q*<sub>des</sub>/*Q*<sub>full</sub>, *d*/*D*, and surcharge flags (`HC_CAPACITY`, `HC_CAPACITY_WRITE`). When catchments exist, optionally **route catchment flows** through the pipe network so each pipe gets its tributary *Q* instead of a single uniform value.
- **Manning capacity** â€” Full-barrel flow, normal depth, peak velocity, and surcharge flags for every pipe in every pipe network (`HC_PIPES`, `HC_PIPES_WRITE`).
- **Normal-depth hydraulic grade line** â€” Steady HGL at design *Q* using Manning normal depth (partial flow + velocity head), with optional HEC-22 junction and exit minor losses; plan labels on layer `HC-HGL`; optional **3D profile polyline** on layer `HC-HGL-PROFILE` at pipe upstream/downstream ends (`HC_HGL`). Routed catchment *Q* supported when catchments are present.
- **Rational peak flows** â€” `Q = CÂ·iÂ·A` from catchment geometry with composite runoff coefficients (`HC_RATIONAL`).
- **Live NOAA Atlas 14 IDF** â€” PFDS intensityâ€“durationâ€“frequency fetch from drawing geolocation (30-day cache); 25 embedded US city presets as offline fallback (`HC_ATLAS14`, `HC_RATIONAL`).
- **Formula-transparent reports** â€” HTML export with **KaTeX-rendered equations** and step-by-step calculation traces to `Documents\HydroComplete\` (`HC_REPORT`); sealable PDF export with Pro (`HC_REPORT_PDF`). Reports reflect routed per-pipe *Q* when catchment routing is used.
- **Network schematic export** â€” `HC_NETWORK_DIAGRAM` writes an HTML/SVG pipe-network diagram from plan topology for review packages and submittals.
- **Live SSURGO soils** â€” `HC_SOIL` queries USDA SSURGO by drawing geolocation (30-day cache) with regional fallback; surfaces hydrologic soil group, K-factor, and BMP suitability hints.
- **Pro activation** â€” Activate with email and beta token (`hc_live_*`) via online validation or offline stub; `HC_LICENSE` shows tier and last check (`HC_ACTIVATE`, `HC_LICENSE`).
- **Ribbon integration** â€” **HydroComplete â€º Analysis** tab exposes the same commands as the command line.

### Why HydroComplete

| | Typical separate-tool workflow | HydroComplete connector |
|---|---|---|
| Reads geometry from the drawing | Export / re-key | Direct from Civil 3D objects |
| Shows the equation behind every number | No | Yes â€” line by line |
| Results back in the drawing | Manual annotation | MText labels on dedicated layers |
| IDF curves | Manual lookup | Live PFDS + embedded Atlas 14 presets |
| Overload flags at design *Q* | Separate spreadsheet | `HC_CAPACITY` + optional labels |

Civil 3D ships Storm and Sanitary Analysis, and it is capable. HydroComplete is not trying to replace a full hydraulic-modeling suite â€” it targets routine storm-sewer sizing, HGL checks, and defensible reporting where the friction is transcription and reviewability.

### Methods (public domain)

Rational method Â· Kirpich & NRCS time of concentration Â· IDF intensity `i = a/(t+b)^c` Â· Manning circular flow (full barrel + normal depth) Â· HEC-22 minor losses

Every engine result carries a `Steps` trace (label, value, units, formula) â€” the same "show your work" data behind HydroComplete's web app and sealable reports.
